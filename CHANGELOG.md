# Change Log
## 1.16.0
* Added support for using default function parameter values
``` JSON
{
  "scripts": {
    "serve:$config=dev": [
      "ng serve -c=$config"
    ]
  }
}
```
### Usage:
``` bash
npm start serve
npm start serve:acc
```


* Added extra parameter debug logging
``` JSON
Script expanded : {
  "parameters": {
    "config": "acc"
  },
  "sequential": [
    "ng serve -c=acc"
  ]
}
```
* 

## 1.15.2
### Fixes
* **Windows only:** Bug fix related to change 1.15.1

## 1.15.1
### Changes
* **Windows only:** When using quoted lines on an echo commands, the quotes will be trimmed.

## 1.15.0
### Changes
* Dev dependencies updated
* Added the [pageSize](src/README.md#menu-options) menu option.

## 1.14.2
### Changes
* Updated dependencies
* **Bug fix for #65:** When parsing a config like this example, an error is returned.

### Breaking
**Windows only:** All arguments containing spaces are now surrounded by double quotes. Single quoted arguments containing spaces are convert to double quotes.

## 1.14.1
### Breaking
Added removal of environment and argument escaping. Now the first escape is for **script-launcher**, the second escape is for the shell.
example:
``` JSON
{
  "scripts": {
    "build-stuff": [
      "echo Exmaple 1: '\\$2'",
      "echo Exmaple 2: '\\$PATH'",
      "echo Exmaple 3: '\\${2}'",
      "echo Exmaple 4: '\\${PATH}'"
    ]
  }
}
```

#### New output:
``` bash
Exmaple 1: $2
Exmaple 2: $PATH
Exmaple 3: ${2}
Exmaple 4: ${PATH}
```

#### Old output:
``` bash
Exmaple 1: \$2
Exmaple 2: \$PATH
Exmaple 3: \${2}
Exmaple 4: \${PATH}
```

## 1.14.0
### Changes
* Added support for using separators in the launcher menu.
``` JSON
{
  "menu": {
    "description": "organization",
    "build": {
      "description": "environment",
      "development": "build:acc",
      "acceptance": "build:prd"
    },
    "separator": "",
    "serve": {
      "description": "environment",
      "development": "serve:acc",
      "acceptance": "serve:prd"
    }
  }
}
```

## 1.13.1
### Changes
* Added support for setting environment values to exclusion conditions as well.

## 1.13.0
### Changes
* Added support for setting environment values in conditions
``` JSON
{
  "scripts": {
    "build-stuff": [
      {
        "condition": [
          "myData=example",
          "'$myData'==='example'"
        ],
        "sequential-then": [
          "echo sequential-then"
        ],
        "sequential-else": [
          "echo sequential-else"
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "options": {
    "logLevel": 2
  }
}
```

## 1.12.1
### Changes
* Removed the throw exception when using a nested settings array

## 1.12.0
### Changes
* Updated the conditions parser
* Changed the **repeater** statements assessor variable name to **$_**
* Minor changes to the init examples
* Updated Script expanded log output

### Breaking
* The **sequential** and **concurrent** statements no longer work in conjunction with the **condition** and **exclusion** statements. Use the **sequential-then**, **sequential-else**, **concurrent-then** and **concurrent-else** when working with conditions and or exclusions. Open the [Condition and exclusion constraints](src/README.md#condition-and-exclusion-constraints) topic for examples.
* The **sequential-then** and **concurrent-then** statements will only be processed when there is a constraint specified that evaluates to a success value.
* When working with repeaters the repeated value in no longer accessible via the repeater variable name. The repeated values are now accessible by using the $_ prefix. Open the [Repeaters](src/README.md#repeaters) topic for examples.
``` JSON
{
  "scripts": {
    "ping": [
      {
        "repeater": "$launch_setting_servers",
        "sequential": [
          "echo $_name",
          "--",
          "echo Action: $launch_setting_command $_host",
          ""
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "settings": {
    "command": "ping",
    "servers": [
      {
        "name": "Google",
        "host": "www.google.com"
      },
      {
        "name": "DuckDuckGo",
        "host": "duckduckgo.com"
      },
      {
        "name": "Bing",
        "host": "bing.com"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## 1.11.1
### Changes
* Updated the Script expanded log output
* Added support for an else statements:
``` JSON
{
  "scripts": {
    "example": [
      {
        "condition": "exit 1",
        "sequential-then": [
          "echo Sequential then: condition action."
        ],
        "sequential-else": [
          "echo Sequential else: condition action."
        ]
      },
      {
        "exclusion": "exit 1",
        "sequential-then": [
          "echo Sequential then: exclusion action."
        ],
        "sequential-else": [
          "echo Sequential else: exclusion action."
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Fixes
* Script scoping fix so current directory and environment variables are no longer shared between script blocks.

### Changes
* Updated to deepmerge 3.3.0
* Updated to inquirer 6.4.1

* Added support for settings arrays in conjunction with the repeater statement
``` JSON
{
  "scripts": {
    "ping": [
      {
        "repeater": "$launch_setting_servers",
        "sequential": [
          "echo $launch_setting_servers_name",
          "--",
          "echo Action: $launch_setting_command $launch_setting_servers_host",
          ""
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "settings": {
    "command": "ping",
    "servers": [
      {
        "name": "Google",
        "host": "www.google.com"
      },
      {
        "name": "DuckDuckGo",
        "host": "duckduckgo.com"
      },
      {
        "name": "Bing",
        "host": "bing.com"
      }

}
``` 



## 1.10.3
### Changes
* Update dependencies to ~ matches the most recent patch version, to fix issue with inquirer@6.4.0

## 1.10.2
### Changes
* Refactored environment value pre-processing.

### Breaking
* Environment value can no longer be used for function resolving. Environment values will only be resolved on the execution part of script launcher.

### Fixes
* Recently assigned environment values can now be used as a function parameters.
``` JSON
{
  "scripts": {
    "download:$env": [
      "echo Download:$env"
    ],
    "build": [
      "environment=$1",
      "echo Build:$environment",
      "download:$environment"
    ]
  }
}
```

## 1.10.1
* Refactoring related to the environment value processing.

### Fixes
* In some edge cases $launch_time_current or $launch_time_elapsed could have the wrong value.
* When using $launch_time_current or $launch_time_elapsed in the first script, they were empty.

## 1.10.0
### Changes
* Added the possibility to set [globing options](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob#options)
``` JSON
{
  "options": {
    "glob": {
      "nonull": false
    }
  }
}
```

## 1.9.1
### Changes
* Added log output for settings environment values.
* Changed log output so all strings are now formatted using single quotes.

### Fixes
* When setting environment values that were using previous set values, it was failing to do so. Now environment variable expansion is done before setting environment values to fix the problem.
example of the problem:
``` JSON
{
  "scripts": {
    "environment": [
      "value1='My Data'",
      "value2=$value1",
      "echo Success value1='$value1'",
      "echo Was failing value2='$value2'"
    ]
  }
}
```

## 1.9.0
### Changes
* Added support for brace expansion on command line arguments.
example:
``` JSON
{
  "scripts": {
    "build-stuff": [
      "echo Argument 1: ${1}",
      "echo Argument 2: ${2}",
      "echo Argument 3: ${3}"
    ]
  }
}
```
* Added support for offset expansion on command line arguments.
example:
``` JSON
{
  "scripts": {
    "build-stuff": [
      "echo Argument 1: ${2*}",
      "echo Argument 2: $2*"
    ]
  }
}
```
* Added support for expansion character escaping
example:
``` JSON
{
  "scripts": {
    "build-stuff": [
      "echo Exmaple 1: \\$2",
      "echo Exmaple 2: \\$PATH",
      "echo Exmaple 3: \\${2}",
      "echo Exmaple 4: \\${PATH}"
    ]
  }
}
```

      [
        "echo Config: $config"
      ],
      {
        "sequential": [
          "echo Config: $config"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
``` 
* Bug fix so Condition and Exclusion on the first script level are now working.
example:
``` JSON
{
  "scripts": {
    "build-stuff": {
      "exclusion": "node_modules",
